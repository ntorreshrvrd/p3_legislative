	"question": "Is the procurement process for my jurisdiction amenable to public private partnership solicitation?",
	"description": "<p>Do I have the legal authority to participate in a public private partnership?  Your legal advisers will play a pivotal role in helping you answer this foundational question.  If you get a positive answer, then do any of the legislative procurement framework applicable to a public private partnership place an inordinate burden on private sector participation in a procurement process, i.e., are there open government public access document/audit requirements inimical to potential private partner participants; are there local workforce, locally sourced materials or small/minority owned business participation requirements disproportionately applied to a public private partnership versus a traditional procurement?</p>",
